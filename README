## Bio
My name is Phill Henning, I'm based out of Ontario Canada. Over the last few years I've transitioned into my role as a (S)ite (R)eliability (E)ngineering. During my 1 year at Bitovi I have had the chance to work with some interesting clients who never cease to provide challenging puzzles for me to solve. Additionally I've been apart of the BitOps V2 rewrite which I will be speaking about today :)
